# Assignment: TO-DO List

## Objective:
Create a **TO-DO List** application that allows users to:

1. Add tasks to a list.
2. Mark tasks as completed.
3. Delete tasks from the list.
4. Edit existing tasks.
5. Persist tasks locally (e.g., using LocalStorage or any other method).
6. Add a **date** functionality to each task (e.g., set a due date for tasks).

## Requirements:
- The application should have the following features:
  1. A text input field for entering a new task.
  2. A button to add the task to the list.
  3. Each task should have:
     - A way to mark it as completed.
     - A way to delete it.
     - An option to edit the task.
     - A date input to set a due date for the task.
  4. Tasks should persist even after the page is refreshed.
  5. The list should be visually organized (use of proper styling and UI).

## Additional Functionality:
- Implement date functionality for each task, allowing users to set and display due dates.
